                use that to try and log into other accounts. So while some
                accounts might seem insignificant, you should always use a
                unique password. Password managers help a lot, and there are a
                lot of options online for various applications.</span

                uppercase, numbers, and special characters takes (roughly) 12
                minutes to brute force. A 12 character one with the same
                criteria, takes 20 years. Prioritize length over complexity, but

              Discretely installing a file, or making my website look like a
              Google log in, isn't hard and is a common way to steal passwords.
              Another huge risk is links. Links can be sending you anywhere, it
              is often smart to open a new tab and navigate to where ever you
              need from there and not follow any suspicious links.</span
